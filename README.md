# Personal Projects
Here are some code samples I have built on the side.

<b>My DT Journal</b> - A Single Page Application built to store one's journal entries. Built with AngularJS and Firebase

<b>Projectify</b> - A Wordpress Plugin that allows each post to be like a project, which adds extra fields such as time, cost, and duration.

<b> Movie Database </b>- Simple website that lists all movies under a certain title. Was built with basic HTML, CSS, JQuery, AJAX and integrated the Movie Database APIs
